# Affinity and Anti-affinity type Pod Scheduling

In Kubernetes scheduling, the terms **soft** and **hard** typically refer to the **scheduling constraints** or **affinity rules**. These determine how strictly the scheduler should enforce a particular condition when placing Pods on nodes.

* **Hard requirements** (sometimes called **required rules**) are conditions that **must** be satisfied for a Pod to be scheduled.
* **Soft requirements** (or **preferred rules**) are conditions that the scheduler tries to satisfy, but if they can't be met, the Pod will still be scheduled elsewhere.

Let's break it down with respect to **affinity**, **node affinity**, and **Pod affinity/anti-affinity**.

### 1. **Hard Requirements: `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`**

When you define **hard requirements**, the Kubernetes scheduler **must** satisfy these constraints. If they can’t be satisfied, the Pod won’t be scheduled. This is often used in `nodeAffinity`, `podAffinity`, and `podAntiAffinity` rules.

#### Example with **Node Affinity** (Hard requirement):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
                - ssd
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

* Here, **`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`** means that the scheduler **must** place the Pod only on nodes with the label `disktype=ssd`. If no such node is available, the Pod will not be scheduled.

#### Example with **Pod Affinity** (Hard requirement):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: frontend
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname  # Ensures the Pod runs on the same node as `app=frontend`
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

* The **`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`** rule here ensures that the Pod will be scheduled **only** on a node that already has a Pod with the `app=frontend` label.

### 2. **Soft Requirements: `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`**

Soft requirements (or **preferred rules**) are conditions that **should** be met, but if they can’t be satisfied, the Pod will still be scheduled on another node that doesn’t necessarily meet those criteria.

#### Example with **Node Affinity** (Soft requirement):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 100  # Preference weight
          preference:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: disktype
                operator: In
                values:
                  - ssd
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

* The **`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`** rule here means the scheduler **prefers** to place the Pod on a node with the `disktype=ssd` label. However, if such a node is unavailable, the scheduler will place the Pod on another node without that label.

#### Example with **Pod Affinity** (Soft requirement):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        preference:
          matchLabels:
            app: frontend  # Prefer scheduling the Pod on a node with `app=frontend` Pods
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

* The **`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`** rule here means that the scheduler will try to place the Pod on the same node as Pods with the `app=frontend` label, but if no such node is available, it will still schedule the Pod elsewhere.

### 3. **Key Differences Between Hard and Soft Constraints**

| Feature                  | **Hard Requirement** (Required)                                                            | **Soft Requirement** (Preferred)                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**           | A condition that **must** be satisfied for scheduling.                                     | A condition that **should** be satisfied but isn’t mandatory.                                                 |
| **Effect on Scheduling** | If the condition isn't met, the Pod won’t be scheduled.                                    | The Pod will still be scheduled, even if the condition isn't met.                                             |
| **Usage**                | Used when you need to enforce strict rules (e.g., must run on nodes with specific labels). | Used for non-critical preferences (e.g., prefer nodes with more CPU, or co-locate Pods with specific labels). |
| **Example**              | `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` in `nodeAffinity` or `podAffinity`.       | `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` in `nodeAffinity` or `podAffinity`.                         |

### 4. **Combining Hard and Soft Requirements**

You can combine both **hard** and **soft** requirements in the same `affinity` block. For instance, you can specify a hard rule for node selection and a soft rule to express a preference for co-locating the Pod with another application.

#### Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
                - ssd
    podAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        preference:
          matchLabels:
            app: frontend
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

* **Hard requirement**: The Pod must run on a node labeled `disktype=ssd`.
* **Soft requirement**: The scheduler prefers to run this Pod on the same node as a `frontend` Pod, but it will still be scheduled elsewhere if necessary.

### Conclusion

* **Hard requirements** (`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) are strict constraints that must be satisfied for a Pod to be scheduled.
* **Soft requirements** (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) are preferences that Kubernetes tries to meet but allows flexibility if they can’t be satisfied.

By using both, you can fine-tune how Pods are scheduled, balancing between strict constraints and preferred behaviors.
